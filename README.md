# Video Game Sales Data Analysis Project (MAT234)

This repository contains my final project for the MAT234 course, which focuses on statistical analysis of video game sales data from 1997-2019. The project includes hypothesis testing, confidence interval construction, and regression analysis to explore trends and relationships in sales data.

## Overview

This project analyzes video game sales data using statistical techniques. The dataset includes:
- Game titles
- Platforms (e.g., Xbox, PlayStation)
- Genres (e.g., Racing, Role-Playing, Platform)
- Regional sales (North America, Europe, Japan, and Others)
- Global sales figures

### Objectives
1. Random sampling of video games by genre and region.
2. Calculation of sample and population statistics (mean, variance, standard deviation).
3. Construction of confidence intervals.
4. Hypothesis testing to evaluate sample mean estimations.
5. Regression analysis to identify relationships between sales in different regions.

## Methodology

### Steps Performed
1. **Random Sampling**:
   - Used Excel's RAND function to sample games from specific genres and the global dataset.

2. **Statistical Analysis**:
   - Computed sample and population statistics (mean, variance, standard deviation).
   - Constructed 95% and 97% confidence intervals.

3. **Hypothesis Testing**:
   - Formulated null and alternative hypotheses.
   - Calculated test statistics, critical values, and p-values.
   - Interpreted results to accept or reject hypotheses.

4. **Regression Analysis**:
   - Analyzed relationships between sales in different regions (e.g., North America vs. Europe).
   - Used scatter plots, regression lines, and r-values to determine trends.

## Files
